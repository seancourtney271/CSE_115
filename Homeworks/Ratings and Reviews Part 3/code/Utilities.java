     * Computes the Bayesian average for the given inputs. The Bayesian average is computed
     * by adding a fixed number of extra ratings at a certain value to the current rating.
     *
     * Background: Sorting rated items by their Bayesian average can improve the usefulness of
     * their rankings. For example, an item with 1 rating of 5 with no other ratings will
     * be ranked higher than an item with 200 ratings at an average rating of 4.9. Most
     * likely we would prefer the later item. To address this we can rank the items by their
     * Bayesian rating and choose 5 extra ratings of 3 to be added to each item. Now the
     * first item has 1 rating of 5 and 5 ratings of 3 for a Bayesian average of 3.33 and the
     * second item has 200 ratings at an average of 4.9 and 5 ratings of 3 for a Bayesian
     * average of 4.85. Bayesian averages can be used in this way to lower ratings where
     * there is not enough information to make a judgment on the item.
     *
     * Hint: You can call your updateAverage method in a loop to complete this method
     *
     * @param average              The current average rating

     * @param numberOfExtraRatings The number of extra ratings to be added to the current average
     * @param extraRatingValue     The value of the extra ratings
     * @return The new average after the extra ratings have been taken into account
